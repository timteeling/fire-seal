<h3 class="mt">Fire-Stopping</h3>
<p>Fire-stopping is a fire protection system made of various components used to seal openings and joints in fire-resistance rated wall and/or floor and/ or roof assemblies.</p>

<p>The most common forms of Fire-stopping are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Top of wall</li>
<li>Bottom of wall</li>
<li>Curtain wall</li>
<li>HVAC mechanical penetrations</li>
<li>Plumbing and Piping Penetrations</li>
<li>Electrical penetrations</li>
<li>EMAT (Endothermic Mat)</li>
<li>High Traffic openings</li>
<li>Data Penetrations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fire Proofing</h3>

<ul>
<li>New Construction, Repairs /Renovations and Maintenance</li>
<li>Spray- Applied Fireproofing</li>
<li>Cementitious and Mineral Fiber fireproofing</li>
<li>Intumescent coatings and fireproofing</li>
<li>Rigid board fireproofing</li>
<li>Industrial Coatings</li>
<li>Thermal insulation</li>
<li>Acoustical insulation</li>
<li>System Documentation and Labeling</li>
</ul>

<h3>How do I introduce this?</h3>
<p>Cementitious or wet mix fireproofing is mixed with water and pumped under pressure through hoses to a nozzle where air is introduced. The wet slurry is then broadcast onto structural steel surfaces. The inherent fire resistive mechanism of products is the release of water, in the form of steam, when exposed to elevated temperatures. Products are available in standard, medium and high density for use indoors and on building exteriors.</p> 

<p>We provide customers with cementitious fireproofing from vendors including Carboline Company and Isolatek International.</p>
